DMTN-151
========

This document argues that, in order to better enable extragalactic transient science with brokers, two new DIAObject catalog elements should be computed and included in the alert packets: (1) the objectId for the three Object catalog galaxies with the lowest separation distance (based on the galaxyâ€™s 2D luminosity profile) from the DIAObject, and (2) the separation distances for those three Objects.

Updating acronyms
-----------------

A table of the technote's acronyms and their definitions are maintained in the `acronyms.tex` file, which is committed as part of this repository.
To update the acronyms table in ``acronyms.tex``::

    make acronyms.tex

*Note: this command requires that this repository was cloned as a submodule.*

The acronyms discovery code scans the LaTeX source for probable acronyms.
You can ensure that certain strings aren't treated as acronyms by adding them to the `skipacronyms.txt <./skipacronyms.txt>`_ file.

The lsst-texmf_ repository centrally maintains definitions for LSST acronyms.
You can also add new acronym definitions, or override the definitions of acronyms, by editing the `myacronyms.txt <./myacronyms.txt>`_ file.

Updating lsst-texmf
-------------------

`lsst-texmf`_ includes BibTeX files, the ``lsstdoc`` class file, and acronym definitions, among other essential tooling for LSST's LaTeX documentation projects.
To update to a newer version of `lsst-texmf`_, you can update the submodule in this repository::

   git submodule update --init --recursive

Commit, then push, the updated submodule.
